I’D LEARNED TO dread turning that corner. It was the first corner out of the<br>
gate from Magallanes Village, where my family’s house is, feeding into Epifanio de los Santos Avenue, <br>
the perpetually snarled main highway in Manila. Since heading back home to the Philippines over the<br>
Thanksgiving holiday, I’d have to turn that corner every time I wanted to meet up with friends at a bar, <br>
join my parents for dinner at a restaurant, or just try to get a coffee. And that’s when I’d see it.<br>

The traffic. Crawling as far as I could see in both directions. A jumble of steel and tires,<br>
nearly at a standstill, except for the abrupt angles of vehicles jockeying, futilely, <br>
for a better position in the slog. All you could do was insert yourself in the stream and wait.<br>
It was excruciating; you felt powerless in the herd. I grew up here,<br>
and I’ve visited many times in past years. And I never remember it being this bad.<br>
